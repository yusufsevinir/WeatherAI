# WeatherAI - Smart Weather Forecasting Agent

An AI-powered weather agent that provides intelligent weather forecasts and responds to natural language queries about weather conditions.

## Features

- Historical weather data processing
- Weather forecasting using ML models
- Natural language query understanding
- Multiple output formats (text, tables, charts)
- Support for multiple cities
- Interactive web interface

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots demonstrating the WeatherAI web interface in action:

## Getting Started

This project consists of two main components:

1. **Backend Service**: A FastAPI-based service that handles weather data processing, AI/ML predictions, and API endpoints.
   - See [Backend README](backend/README.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

2. **Frontend Application**: A web interface for interacting with the weather agent.
   - See [Frontend README](frontend/README.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yusufsevinir/WeatherAI.git
cd WeatherAI
```

2. Follow the setup instructions in the [Backend README](backend/README.md) to get started with the backend service.
